# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
I used mainly two gems artii, terminal_table.
I installed both of the gems and by checking their basic syntax i used them.
I used terminal_table gem to print the output in clear table format

  a) Feature 1…multiple deletion , which it deletes multiple items at the same time.

  b) Feature 2…installed terminal_table ruby gem, in which it displays the output in table format.

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
I spent almost 6hrs to get the project succeed without any errors. 

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
After installing terminal table gem, understanding the syntax of that gem take time.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
Firstly i added multiple deletion, instead of calling the delete method every time, it deletes the multiple items in array at a time.
Second feature i used terminal table gem, to see the output in clear way.
I also printed item type to clearly get an idea which type it is.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
I still have to learn more about different types of gems, have to work more on modules and have to do these more of these kind of projects.
